### Summary
Motivated and goal-oriented Junior Software engineer with a solid foundation in software development and data analysis with a passion for technology.  I’ve recently finished the 3rd semester of Master of Information Technology at RMIT University. The study provided me hands-on experience in programming languages such as Java and Python. I also have a strong background in data analytics from previous roles. Now I’m actively involved in GradGirls program to enhance my technical and communication skills.
